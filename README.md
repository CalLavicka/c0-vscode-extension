# C0 extension for VSCode

This provides IDE features for C0, such as code completion, parse errors/typechecking errors, go-to-definition, etc. A local installation of C0 is not necessary 

## Usage

The extension will activate when opening a C0/C1 file. To select the C0 theme, press CMD+SHIFT+P or CTRL+SHIFT+P, type "color theme", and select C0-light or C0-dark

To activate code completion, press CTRL-SPACE. To go to the definition of something, CMD+click or CTRL+click on it. 

### Multi-file projects

The extension needs to know in what order to load files. To do so, you should provide a `project.txt` file in the main directory of your project. It should be a list of the files in the order you would compile them

Example: 
```
lib/hdict.c1
lib/peg-util.c1
lib/stacks.c1
peg-moves.c1
peg1.c1
peg2.c1
peg-main.c1
```

The extension will look for `project.txt` first in the same directory as the current source file, one directory above that, and then in the workspace root. 

## Features

* View parse and typechecking errors as you type 
* View a function/variable/struct field's type by hovering over it
* CTRL-SPACE will suggest variables which are in scope and function names, struct field names
* Command/Ctrl click to go to a definition for almost anything
* Full support for C0 standard library
* Full support for all C0/C1 features, including `#use "foo.c0"` and C1 features
* Highlighting for C0-specific features
* New C0-specific themes 

## Development

* First, clone the repository. Make sure you have `npm` installed.
* `npm install` on the root directory to install dependecies
* `npm run compile` to generate the parser and to compile the typescript
* `code -n .` to open it up in VSCode! (If you don't have the command on your path just open the workspace)
* Hit `F5` to start debugging the extension in a new window. Be sure that the
debug configuration is set to "Launch Client". After that's launched you can switch
the debug config to "Attach to Server" and start debugging that. 


## Structure

* Root directory: Contains package.json for extension, as well as syntax highlighting
* `client`: Contains client-code, which for now just starts up the language server
    * `src`: Contains the source files for the client code. Probably doesn't have to be touched.
* `server`: Contains server functions.
    * `src`: Contains the typescript source directory for the client code
        * `server.ts`: The main typescript file which sends diagnostic, autocompletion, etc. info to the client.
        * `validate-document.ts`: Parses one file, including dependencies
        * `ast-search.ts`: Responsible for getting information from the AST given a document position 
        * `parse`: Contains parsing code adapted from JaC0
        * `typecheck`: Contains typechecking code adapted from JaC0
    * `syntax`: Contains the nearley files which compile to typescript
* `language-configuration.json`: Some configurations for C0, such as brackets and comments.
* `syntaxes/C0.tmLanguage.json`: The syntax highlighting for VSCode.
